single block for repo creation :

cd /path/to/your/repo
git init
git remote remove origin // to clear any that were before
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/repoName.git
git remote -v // confirm origin was added correctly, fetch , pull
git add . // add directory
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main

### Steps to Initialize a Local Repository, Add Remote Origin, and Push to GitHub

1. **Navigate to Your Local Repository:**
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/repo

    Initialize the Repository (if not already done):

    sh

git init

Remove Existing Remote Origin:

sh

git remote remove origin

Add the Correct Remote Origin:

sh

git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-repo-name.git

Verify the Remote:

sh

git remote -v

Add and Commit Your Files (if not already done):

sh

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

Push to GitHub:

sh

    git push -u origin main

Additional Tips:

    Check SSH Configuration:
    Ensure your SSH keys are correctly configured and added to your GitHub account to avoid any authentication issues.

    Branch Name:
    Make sure you are pushing to the correct branch. If your default branch is main, use main; if it's master, use master.

    Remote Verification:
    Always verify the remote URLs with git remote -v to ensure they are correctly set.
